<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The stories of this book have been chosen
for the purpose of showing how the early Red
Men accounted for the phenomena of nature&mdash;the
presence of the birds, the moaning of the
wind, the whispering of the leaves. The nature
myths of the North American Indian are full
of poetry, and occasionally of a rich humor.
In retelling the stories for children the author
has sought to retain the original spirit of the
tales, and through them to give to the reader
a better understanding of the inner life and
thought of the primitive Red Man at his best.
The tales have been gathered from many
sources, and are representative of many tribes.</p>

<p>It is well known that the same tale in varying
form is told among many different tribes,
just as the folk tales have been carried in early
times from one nation to another and are variously
accredited. It is not always possible to
determine the original source.</p>

<p>Before reading or telling the Indian Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
Myths to the children, it is best to explain that
just as they love to wonder and imagine about
the new and strange sights and sounds of the
world, so the early races of men, the children
of time, loved to wonder and imagine. And
so these stories of nature grew out of their
imaginings; and some of the stories are so
beautiful, and some of them are so odd, that
men have repeated them from one generation
to another, ever since,&mdash;for even when they no
longer believed them to be true, they loved
them.</p>

<br />
(Ojibwa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a little Indian boy who
wanted above everything else to become a
mighty hunter.</p>

<p>His father, whose name was Ojeeg, the Fisher,
was the mightiest hunter of his tribe, and
Omeme wanted to be like his father.</p>

<p>Often he went out into the forest with the
little bow and arrows which his father had made
for him, to hunt the small creatures of the woods.
But it was too cold for him to stay long; for in
those days there were no seasons, only cold and
snow day after day, moon following moon.</p>

<p>So little Omeme often came back to the lodge
with fingers stiff and numb. As he shivered and
held his fingers over the fire of the lodge, he
cried, &ldquo;There is nothing for Omeme to shoot.
The birds fly up to the sun for warmth. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
little creatures hide in the forest: they hide far
down beneath the snow blanket. It is cold.
Omeme can get no game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day Omeme met a squirrel in the forest,
and the squirrel said, &ldquo;Do not shoot me, Omeme.
I will tell you a great secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Omeme said, &ldquo;I will not shoot you. Tell
me your secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the squirrel said, &ldquo;Away up in the Sky
Land it is always warm. There is no frost, no
snow. If we could have some of the warmth of
the Sky Land, we should not always be cold.
There would be good hunting for Omeme. There
would be plenty for us all to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Sky Land is far away,&rdquo; said Omeme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the squirrel, &ldquo;but Ojeeg is
mighty. Could he not go to the Sky Land and
bring away some of its warmth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is mighty,&rdquo; answered Omeme. &ldquo;I
will ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran home, for he had grown cold while
listening to the squirrel&rsquo;s secret.</p>

<p>Ojeeg was in the lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my father,&rdquo; exclaimed Omeme, &ldquo;all we
little creatures are so cold! The squirrel tells
me there is warmth in the Sky Land. Could you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
not go there and bring some of its warmth to
the earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;OMEME SAID, &lsquo;I WILL NOT SHOOT YOU. TELL ME
YOUR SECRET&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ojeeg was silent for a long, long time. He
loved Omeme dearly. He was sorry that Omeme
was cold. But the journey to the Sky Land was
long. It was full of dangers.</p>

<p>At length Ojeeg said, &ldquo;The earth <em>is</em> cold. I
will hold a council with my neighbors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Ojeeg, the Fisher, called together his neighbors,
the Otter, the Beaver, the Badger, the
Lynx, and the Wolverine. Long and earnestly
they considered the matter, and at length they
decided to undertake the journey to the Sky
Land.</p>

<p>Upon a given day they started. It was a great
adventure, and Ojeeg felt sure that he would
never return to his lodge, and never again would
he see the little Omeme.</p>

<p>For a long, long distance they traveled and at
last, tired and spent with hunger, they reached
the top of a very high mountain. So high it was
that the sky seemed almost to rest upon it.</p>

<p>There they found meat and a fire, as though
some traveler had left them. So they rested
and were refreshed.</p>

<p>Then Ojeeg said to the Otter, &ldquo;Now we will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
try to gain entrance to the Sky Land. It is just
above us. Jump, and see if you cannot break
through, and we will follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Otter tried, but he could not jump high
enough, and he fell, and slid all the way down
to the foot of the mountain. So he gave up and
returned to his home.</p>

<p>Then Ojeeg said to the Beaver, &ldquo;Jump, and
see if you cannot do better than the Otter.&rdquo;
The Beaver jumped; but neither could he jump
high enough, and he too fell, and slid all the
way down to the bottom of the mountain. So
the Beaver gave up, and returned to his home.</p>

<p>Then Ojeeg said to the Badger, &ldquo;Jump. Let
us see if you cannot do better than the Otter
and the Beaver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Badger jumped; but neither could he
jump high enough, and back he slid to the bottom
of the mountain. So the Badger gave up,
and returned to his home.</p>

<p>Then Ojeeg said to the Lynx, &ldquo;Surely you
are stronger than the Otter, and the Beaver,
and the Badger, and you can jump farther. Try,
and see if you cannot break through into the
Sky Land, and we will follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lynx jumped; but neither could he break
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
through the Sky, though he made a deep scratch
upon it with one of his sharp claws; and back
he slid to the bottom of the mountain. So
the Lynx gave up, and returned to his home.</p>

<p>Then said Ojeeg to the Wolverine, &ldquo;You are
stronger and more agile than the others. Jump,
and see if you cannot break through, and I will
follow you. Do your best. You must not fail
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wolverine prepared for a mighty jump.
He sprang upward, and touched the Sky just
where the Lynx&rsquo;s claw had scratched it. He
broke it, and sprang through the opening.</p>

<p>After him sprang Ojeeg, and now they two
were in the Sky Land.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful country. There was no
snow. The winds blew softly; the air was
balmy; and all about them were flowers, and
grass, and singing birds.</p>

<p>Ojeeg stamped hard with his foot, and a great
hole was made where he stamped. Down
through the hole rushed the singing birds, and
the warm air of the Sky Land.</p>

<p>Down went Spring, and after Spring went
Summer, and after Summer went Autumn. But
just as Autumn disappeared, Ojeeg heard a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
noise and shouting, for the people of the Sky
Land were coming. He knew that they would
punish him for his daring.</p>

<p>The Wolverine slipped through the hole and
followed Autumn; but before Ojeeg could follow,
the Sky people came, and the hole was
closed.</p>

<p>Ojeeg ran, but the arrows of the Sky people
were swift, and overtook him.</p>

<p>So Ojeeg gave up his life, but he had sent
warmth to all the creatures of the earth, and
since that time his people have had the four
seasons, instead of one unbroken season of bitter
cold and snow.</p>

<p>The little Omeme was proud of the mighty
deed of his father. He was cold no more: and
he grew up to be a mighty hunter, as his father
the great Ojeeg had been before him.</p>

<p>And when the Indians look up at the stars
and see the constellation of the fish, they say,
&ldquo;That is Ojeeg, the Fisher, who gave the summer
to his people.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>BIRTH OF THE ARBUTUS<br />
<br />
(Ojibwa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG years ago, when only the red men lived
among the hills and valleys of the land, an
old, old man sat shivering over the low fire
of his tepee. The old man was Peboan. He
was chief of the winter spirits.</p>

<p>The outside world was covered with snow.
The branches of the trees bent low with its
weight. The sides of the tepee were heavy
with snow. All the tracks of the bear and the
rabbit were hidden.</p>

<p>The old man shivered, and bent over his fire.
He was clothed in furs, and furs covered the
floor of the tepee. But they could not keep out
the chill winds, for the fire was low. There
was no more wood to replenish it. Snow covered
all the fallen branches, and the chief was
old and feeble.</p>

<p>Peboan had been a mighty hunter. He had
killed the moose and the bear. The skins of
many deer were about him. But now his hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
was white as the icy fringes of the frozen brook.</p>

<p>He blew upon the coals of his fire and they
glowed, bright as the eyes of a startled deer in
the forest. But the glow faded. The old man
shivered.</p>

<p>There was no food in the tepee. The bear
and the rabbit were hidden in the forest. Their
tracks were covered with snow. Peboan could
not hunt them.</p>

<p>Then, upon his knees, he cried to the Great
Spirit for help. He cried for help, that Peboan,
chief of the winter spirits, might not suffer want
and cold.</p>

<p>As he sank once more upon his furs, he felt
a warmth in the tepee. He looked up.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood a youth, whose red
cheeks and sparkling eyes told of health and
strength. A wreath of sweet grass was bound
about his curling locks, and in his hands he
held a cluster of flowers. Light and quick was
his step as he entered the lodge of Peboan.</p>

<p>He smiled upon Peboan, and the old man felt
a warmth enveloping him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enter, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and welcome. I
have no refreshment to offer. But come to my
fire, and tell me who you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>Then the youth said, &ldquo;The Great Spirit has
sent me to Peboan. I am Seegwun, the Spring.
But tell me of yourself, Peboan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Peboan cried, &ldquo;I am the great winter
spirit. When I come to the Earth, all the
Earth&rsquo;s children tremble. I breathe upon them,
and they cry out. The trees drop their leaves.
The birds fly away. The forest children creep
into their holes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried the youth, &ldquo;when I come to the
Earth, the Earth&rsquo;s children laugh and clap their
hands. I breathe upon them and they dance
with joy. The trees put forth their leaves. The
birds come back. The forest children awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peboan continued, &ldquo;When I come to the Earth,
I shake my locks and snow falls from the clouds.
The streams grow hard and still. The wind
sings dirges through the naked trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I come to the Earth,&rdquo; laughed Seegwun,
&ldquo;I shake my ringlets and warm showers
fall from the clouds. The grass awakes. The
flowers bloom. Soft breezes blow. The streams
are glad, and sing as they dance along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peboan,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;the Great Spirit
has sent me to the Earth, and you must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seegwun smiled, and the tepee grew warm.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
Peboan became silent. His head drooped lower
and lower.</p>

<p>The sun shone forth, and the snow melted
beneath its rays.</p>

<p>Then Spring waved his hands over the sleeping
Peboan, and he sank upon the ground.
Smaller and smaller he grew. His clothing
seemed turned to furry leaves, and covered the
floor of the tepee.</p>

<p>The youth smiled, for Peboan was gone.</p>

<p>Softly he lifted the furry leaves, and beneath
each cluster he placed blossoms of white and
pink. He breathed upon them with his fragrant
breath, and they became sweet. Their
spicy odor filled all the tepee.</p>

<p>Then the youth laughed gladly, and went his
way.</p>

<p>The sun shone, and the children of the little
Indian village ran from their homes, and danced
and sang in its warmth. A bird was caroling
in the tree top, and they stopped to listen. The
stream shook off its icy covering and went singing
down its course. The children followed it.</p>

<p>They came to the spot where the tepee of
Peboan had stood. And lo! all the ground was
covered with fragrant flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>&ldquo;The arbutus!&rdquo; cried the children. &ldquo;The
arbutus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They picked the beautiful, fragrant blossoms,
and joyously carried them home. And when
the old people of the village saw them, they
knew that the Spirit of the Spring had returned
to fill the earth with joy and gladness.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>THE MAIDEN WITH GOLDEN HAIR<br />
<br />
(Chippewa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>EELINAU stood in the door of the lodge,
holding in her hand a bunch of dandelions
which had gone to seed. She blew upon them
softly, and the white-winged seeds went floating
into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shawondasee&rsquo;s breath was mightier than
thine,&rdquo; said a voice behind her. She turned
to see her grandmother smiling upon her as
she worked upon a deer-skin moccasin.</p>

<p>Leelinau sat down. &ldquo;Tell me of Shawondasee,&rdquo;
she said coaxingly. So the grandmother
told her the story of the South Wind and the
Dandelion:</p>

<p>Shawondasee lived far away in the South
Land where it was always warm and bright.
His father, Kabeyun, the father of the winds,
had given him this part of the earth in which
to dwell. The soft, warm winds of the South
were given him.</p>

<p>But Shawondasee was not strong, and quick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
and eager, like his brothers who governed the
North Wind, and the West Wind. He was fat,
and lazy, and sluggish. He liked to take life
easily, and moved slowly, when he moved at all.</p>

<p>Sometimes, because he was so fat and heavy,
he sighed deeply, and then his warm breath
would travel far across the land to the North,
and the people would cry, &ldquo;What a balmy day!
How soft and warm the air is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, as Shawondasee looked far away
toward the North, he saw upon the prairie a
beautiful maiden. Her body was tall and slender.
She wore a gown of green, and her hair
was a wonderful yellow, like burnished gold.</p>

<p>Shawondasee looked long upon her, for never
had he seen a maiden like her before. The
Indian maidens had hair of deepest black, like
the glossy feathers of the crow, and their skins
were dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is fair and beautiful,&rdquo; sighed Shawondasee.
&ldquo;I should woo her, if she were not so far
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stirred a little, and sighed, and the air
grew warm, and a soft breeze blew. The beautiful
maiden on the prairie swayed in the breeze,
and her green robe fluttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>&ldquo;She is very beautiful,&rdquo; cried Shawondasee.
&ldquo;I will send her a kiss.&rdquo; So with his softest
breath he sent a kiss to the maiden of the yellow
hair, and again she bowed and swayed.</p>

<p>Still Shawondasee did not leave his home
in the South Land to visit the maiden. He
sent soft breezes to blow upon her, and the
breezes carried sighs and kisses to her; but
Shawondasee himself remained at home. Day
after day he wished that he might win the
maiden with the golden hair. Day after day
he looked toward the North where she stood
and waited for his coming.</p>

<p>Then one morning there was a change. As
Shawondasee looked out upon the prairie he saw
that the beautiful golden hair of the maiden he
loved had turned to snowy white. For once he
was startled. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I have put off going to her, and now I have
lost her. Her golden beauty has changed to a
beauty which is not of this earth. It is now
too late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shawondasee heaved a mighty sigh as he
spoke&mdash;a sigh that stirred all the winds of the
South Land&mdash;and behold! the air was filled with
the silvery white locks of the Dandelion maiden.</p>

fell, there a new flower sprang up, and it was
called the Dandelion.</p>

<p>The old grandmother had finished her story
and her moccasin at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so Shawondasee never married the
Dandelion maiden?&rdquo; questioned Leelinau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the grandmother. &ldquo;He was
far too fat and lazy to win a maiden of spirit.
But then,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;it was no great loss to
either. No Indian of good sense would wed a
maiden with yellow hair.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>ORIGIN OF THE VIOLET<br />
<br />
(Iroquois)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE wonderful deeds had the Indian youth
performed: three deeds for which the older
men of the tribe gave him honor.</p>

<p>First of all he had gone forth with his bow
and arrow and, taking true aim with a strong
and steady hand, had pierced the heart of the
great heron flying overhead: the great heron
that was the enemy of his people. Often had
the bird caught the children of the tribe and carried
them away to devour them. And now the
young brave, who was little more than a lad,
had slain the great heron.</p>

<p>On the second occasion he had gone forth
alone, and sought out the cave of the witches.
And from the cave he had brought away the
roots which alone would cure his people of the
great sickness which we call the plague. The
journey was long and difficult, and food was
scarce, but only the witches knew the secret of
the roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>When the young brave returned with the medicine
and the people were made well, the old men
of the tribe gave him honor, and the women of
the tribe blessed him.</p>

<p>On the third occasion the young warrior led
a band of his fellows in combat with a tribe
of their enemies, and overthrew them. Those
who were not killed fled in confusion. And
again he was honored by all his tribe.</p>

<p>But now the young warrior&rsquo;s mind was
troubled, and favor and honor no longer satisfied
his heart. Among the tribe of the enemy
that he had conquered, he had seen a maiden who
had won his love.</p>

<p>Unknown to her, and hidden, he had watched
as she moved about the wigwam of her father.
He had followed the fleeing enemy, and had come
silently to the outskirts of their village, and
there he discovered the maiden who alone had
stirred his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have her for my very own! She shall
be the light of my wigwam!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>So he stayed in the forest near the village of
the enemy, and there he sang all the songs that
the Indian lover sings, and always they were in
praise of the graceful maiden whom he loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>So sweet and tender were the words, and so
rich the music, that the birds of the forest
learned to sing them after him. And so often
were they repeated that even the roving animals
knew the words, and wondered of whom the
strange warrior sang.</p>

<p>One day the Indian maiden, enticed by the
freshness of the woods and the caroling of the
birds, wandered away to the forest alone. Unknown
to her, a young Indian of her own tribe,
who long had loved her, followed at a distance.</p>

<p>When she reached the forest she listened happily
to the singing birds, and she thought she
heard, too, a strong, clear voice that was different
from the voice of the birds.</p>

<p>Farther into the woods she went, when suddenly
a young brave sprang toward her, clasped
her in his arms, and ran swiftly away, bearing
her with him.</p>

<p>The maiden, looking into his face, saw that
it was strong, and fearless, and loving; and with
his voice he reassured her, promising that he
would do her no harm. And the maiden&rsquo;s heart
went out to him, as his had done to her.</p>

<p>The unseen lover of her own tribe saw what
had happened and, recognizing the young brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
who had stolen the maiden from him as the one
who had defeated his people, was afraid. He
ran back to the village to tell the men, and to get
help for the pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you came back!&rdquo; cried the men of the
village in a voice of scorn. &ldquo;You did not save
the maiden you claim to love! Stay here at
home with the women while we ride forth and
overtake them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the men mounted their ponies and rode
away; and toward evening they came in sight
of the brave young warrior, and the maiden of
their tribe.</p>

<p>But as they drew nearer they saw that the
maiden had braided the long tresses of her hair
and had bound them about the neck of the young
warrior who bore her in his arms. And this was
the sign to them that she loved him, and wished
to go with him and become his wife.</p>

<p>Then the Indians of her own tribe were doubly
angry, and drawing their bows they shot both
the young warrior and the maiden through the
heart, and returned to their own village.</p>

<p>And where the two fell, there sprang from
the earth a new flower, the purple violet, which
speaks of courage and of love.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>THE BEGINNING OF BIRDS<br />
<br />
(Blackfeet)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N very early times, the Red Children believe,
there were no birds. And this is the way
they account for their beginning:</p>

<p>All summer the trees had been full of leaves,
shaking, whispering, dancing, as the winds blew
upon them. &ldquo;I wish I might fly,&rdquo; said one little
leaf. &ldquo;I would go sailing straight up into the
heavens. But the tree holds me tightly; I cannot
get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the tree should let you go, you would
only fall to the ground and die,&rdquo; said a bigger
leaf. &ldquo;It is better to be content as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the leaves fluttered and danced and whispered
one to another, day after day.</p>

<p>One morning the wind was cold, and the
leaves had to dance fast to keep warm. Then
the old tree said, &ldquo;It is the breath of Po-poon-o-ki.
He lives in the ice lodge of the far North.
He will soon visit us, with his war paints. I
must hold you tightly, little leaves, as long as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
I can.&rdquo; But the little leaves did not understand
what the tree meant.</p>

<p>Then, one still night, Po-poon-o-ki came. He
went from tree to tree, and over each one he
splashed his war paints, till the leaves were no
longer green, but dashed with red, and brown,
and yellow, and crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How beautiful the trees are!&rdquo; cried the
Indian children the next morning. &ldquo;See their
bright colors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few days the leaves danced and whispered,
laughing over their beautiful hues. Then
Po-poon-o-ki came back, and with his swift,
cold breath, he blew against the trees, and the
little leaves were tossed and torn from the
friendly branches. They did not fly up into
the heavens, but frightened and sobbing they
dropped to the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall die!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;We shall die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. The guardian
spirit of the tree whispered, &ldquo;No, little leaves,
you shall not die. You shall be changed into
living forms. I will give you breath and life.&rdquo;
And instantly there arose from the earth where
the leaves had dropped, a great flock of winged
birds, red, and brown, and yellow, and crimson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
all the beautiful colors that Po-poon-o-ki had
given the leaves. Then they flew away to the
South Land, where winter&rsquo;s breath could not
reach them.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THERE AROSE A GREAT FLOCK OF WINGED BIRDS&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But in the spring, when Ni-poon-o-ki, the
spirit of summer, came stealing up from the
South, and Po-poon-o-ki went back to his ice
lodge in the far North, then the birds came
back, too. There were new leaves on the trees,
but the birds flew straight to the branches which
had been their home, and there, safely sheltered
by the new leaves, they built their nests.</p>

<p>And after awhile, when there were eggs in
all the home nests, the hearts of the birds became
so full of joy that they could no longer be silent.
Their throats swelled, and opening wide their
little mouths, they filled all the air with bursts
of happy song.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>WHY THE WIND WAILS<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the pale moon looks down from the
sky, and when the wind cries mournfully
around the wigwam, this is the story that the
old man of the tribe tells to the Indian children:</p>

<p>Many, many moons ago the great chief of
our tribe had a very beautiful daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall marry a great warrior,&rdquo; said the
Chief, &ldquo;and a mighty hunter. Then she will
be well cared for, and I shall be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the great Chief kept watch of the young
men of the tribe, to see which one would prove
worthy of his daughter.</p>

<p>One day, as the Chief sat in the door of his
lodge, there came a sudden rushing sound, and
a young man stood before him. It was the
Wind, who had made himself visible that he
might talk with the Chief.</p>

<p>When he had saluted, he said, &ldquo;Great Chief,
I love your daughter. May I carry her away
to my lodge, and make her my wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>The Chief looked at the Wind, and he answered,
&ldquo;No. My daughter is not for such as
you. You are no warrior. You are no hunter.
You love to play pranks. You cannot marry
my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Wind went away sorrowing, for he
loved the Indian maiden.</p>

<p>The next day the maiden came to her father
and said, &ldquo;Father, I love the Wind better than
any young warrior of our tribe. May I go to
his lodge, and be his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chief looked at his daughter and said,
&ldquo;No. The Wind is no mate for you. He is
no warrior. He is no hunter. He loves only
to play pranks. You cannot marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden went away sorrowing, for she
loved the Wind.</p>

<p>The next day when the maiden went out to
gather sweet marsh grass for her basket weaving,
she heard a sudden rushing sound above
her head. She looked up, and as she looked
the Wind swept down and carried her in his
arms far away to his lodge.</p>

<p>There they lived happily together, for the
maiden became his wife. But the great Chief
was full of wrath. He hunted through all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
land for the lodge of the Wind, but he could
not find it for many moons. Still he would not
give up the search, for his heart was hot with
wrath.</p>

<p>One day the Wind heard a great crashing
sound among the trees near his lodge, and his
heart stood still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your father,&rdquo; he cried, and he hid the
Chief&rsquo;s daughter in a thicket, while he made
himself invisible, that he might stay close beside
her.</p>

<p>The great Chief looked inside the lodge of
the Wind, but he found it empty. Then he
went through the brush, striking to right and
left with his heavy club, and calling, &ldquo;My
daughter: my daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the Wind&rsquo;s wife heard her father&rsquo;s
voice, she answered, &ldquo;Oh, my father, strike not!
We are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before her words could reach him, the
Chief swung his great club once more, and it
fell upon the head of the invisible Wind, who,
without a sound, dropped unconscious upon the
ground. And because he was invisible, neither
the Chief nor his daughter knew what had
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>Then the Chief took his daughter in his arms
and hastened back to his tribe. But each day
she grew more and more sorrowful, and longed
for her husband, the Wind.</p>

<p>For many hours the Wind lay unconscious
beside his lodge. When he awakened, the Chief
and his daughter had gone. Sorrowfully he set
out in search of his wife. He traveled to her
father&rsquo;s tribe, and there at last he found her.
But she was in a canoe with her father, far out
upon the lake.</p>

<p>Then the Wind cried, &ldquo;Come to me, my loved
one,&rdquo; and his voice swept out over the water.</p>

<p>The Chief said, &ldquo;The winds are blowing,&rdquo;
but his daughter knew her husband&rsquo;s voice.
She could not see him, for he was still invisible,
but she lifted herself up in the canoe and
stretched out her hands toward the shore. As
she did so a breeze stirred the water, and the
canoe overturned.</p>

<p>The Chief&rsquo;s daughter threw up her arms,
and the Wind tried to catch her in his embrace,
but he was too late. The Great Spirit bore her
far up into the sky, and there he gave her a
home where she would live forever in the lodge
of the moon.</p>

the power to become visible to men.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>STORY OF THE HUMMING BIRD<br />
<br />
(Shoshonee)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>EE!&rdquo; said the Indian grandfather, as he
sat in the opening of his tepee. &ldquo;See the
little Fire Bird! How swiftly it darts! Now
it drinks honey from the flowers. How fast its
wings move!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little Indian boy stood quietly at his grandfather&rsquo;s
side. &ldquo;I see the fire on its throat,&rdquo; he
said softly, and then, as the bird darted away,
he begged, &ldquo;Tell me the story of the little Fire
Bird, grandfather. I like the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the grandfather told this tale, which his
grandfather had told to him:</p>

<p>Long, long ago the Indian people lived in a
country where it was cold, and the snow fell
for many, many days. The falling snow covered
the tracks of the forest children, so the hunters
could find little meat. Many times the Indian
children cried to the Great Spirit for warmth,
and for better hunting.</p>

<p>Far to the west of the Indian village there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
was a high mountain; and often the people
watched the red sun as he sank from sight
beyond the mountain, and all the sky was filled
with brightness.</p>

<p>One night a little child went running about
the tepees calling, &ldquo;Come, come; see the sun!
See the sun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people looked toward the west. All the
sky was bright; and they said, &ldquo;The sun is
touching the mountain top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the brightness did not fade away as they
watched. Instead, while darkness fell all about
the village, the red fire burned brighter and
brighter at the top of the mountain. The people
cried, &ldquo;The sun is resting. He does not move.
He does not sink behind the mountain!&rdquo; Then
they were frightened, for they knew not what
to think.</p>

<p>All night they watched, and still the bright
light shone above the mountain top. It flashed,
and threw fiery darts far into the heavens; and
the Indians said, &ldquo;The sun is angry. Perhaps
he will destroy the earth&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then their wonder grew as far away in the
east a light began to glow. It grew brighter and
brighter,&mdash;and then the sun arose on the eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
horizon! The people knew then that the light
upon the mountain was not the light of the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is <em>fire</em> in the mountain,&rdquo; they cried,
&ldquo;and fire is warm. It is beckoning to us with
its hands. Let us move nearer to the fire mountain.
It will not be so cold there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the people of the village marched westward
toward the mountain. The bright light
had gone, but a cloud of smoke hung above it.</p>

<p>For several days they journeyed, and at last
they reached the foot of the mountain, and there
they camped.</p>

<p>Then two of their bravest warriors climbed
up the mountain, until they came to its very
top, and there they looked down into a great
opening, shaped like a mammoth bowl, and it
was full of fire! Then they hastened down and
told the people.</p>

<p>The people rejoiced, and said, &ldquo;The fire in the
mountain will keep us warm. It will be good
to live here.&rdquo; And they made them a new village
at the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>For many moons the people dwelt there, hunting
and fishing, making their beads and moccasins.
Then one day a strange noise was heard.
It was as though the mountain coughed&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
great, hoarse, rumbling cough, like that of some
huge giant.</p>

<p>The people stood still and listened! There
was another sound like the first, but heavier,
more convulsive.</p>

<p>Then a great flash of fire shot up from the
mountain top, and fell again. Then another,
and another, and each time the fire leaped higher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us run!&rdquo; cried the people. &ldquo;Let us
run!&rdquo; Even as they spoke there was a great
burst of fire and smoke, and huge stones were
thrown high in the air, and a stream came pouring
down the side of the mountain&mdash;a stream
that looked like liquid fire.</p>

<p>Then the Indians ran, indeed, and there was
no time to save anything but their own lives!</p>

<p>Many streams followed the first one, coming
like fiery serpents down the mountain side, and
above were heavy smoke clouds, shot with bursting
rocks.</p>

<p>Far away the Indian people ran, crying, &ldquo;The
Fire Spirit is angry! What have we done that
he should destroy our homes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last they stopped, and turned to look back
at the fire mountain. The flames were gone:
only a cloud of smoke hung about. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
fiery streams had burned all that was in their
way; and rocks and ashes had buried what the
fire streams had not destroyed.</p>

<p>Then the people prayed to the Great Spirit,
and as the Great Spirit looked down upon the
mountain and saw what destruction had been
wrought, he said, &ldquo;Your flames shall be put
out; your fires shall be quenched.&rdquo; And even
as the Great Spirit spoke, the fires grew ashen
in color, and the flames trembled and sank
away.</p>

<p>But in the center of the great bowl of the
mountain, where the fires had been, one little
flame hung quivering. The Great Spirit saw it,
and he said, &ldquo;Little flame, you alone shall stay.
But I will give to you a new form. You shall
have wings, and live among the earth&rsquo;s people,
and drink the honey of its flowers. Little flame,
you shall carry the color of the fire upon your
throat. You shall be known as the Humming
Bird, and every child will love you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>THE GIFT OF INDIAN CORN<br />
<br />
(Chippewa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the far back days, before the white men
lived upon this side of the earth, a young
Indian lad stood at the door of his father&rsquo;s
tepee and gazed out over the far-waving prairie
grass.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the morrow when he
would begin his fast; for this was the custom
among the Indians. When a youth reached a
given age he went away by himself, and for
seven days he ate no food, but spent the time
in prayer to the Great Spirit that his part in
life might be made clear to him, and that it
might prove a worthy one.</p>

<p>Now Wunzh, who stood in the tepee door, was
an unusually thoughtful lad, for his father had
so taught him; and he was filled with high and
with grave thoughts as he looked across the
waving grass.</p>

<p>Beyond his sight, in a thicket, he knew that
his father and younger brother were clearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
the ground and raising the little tepee wherein
he would spend the days of his fasting.</p>

<p>Wunzh knew full well what his prayer to the
Great Spirit would be, but how would it be
answered? He thought of this long and often.</p>

<p>As he had run about the prairie or made his
way through the forests when a little lad, he
had wondered how it was that the grass and
the trees sprang up out of the dark earth. He
had wondered why some of the flowers smelled
sweet while others were offensive; why some
of the roots were good for healing, while others
caused sickness or even death, though all came
from the same soil. But to none of these questions
could he find an answer.</p>

<p>Wunzh&rsquo;s father was poor, and so were many
other Indians; and some of them were ill, or
very old. But in order to live they must hunt
or fish, for game and fish were their only food.
And so life was hard for many of the Indians.</p>

<p>Since Wunzh was thoughtful and had considered
all these things, he knew full well what
his prayer to the Great Spirit would be.</p>

<p>On the following day he left the tepee of his
father and went to the little clearing in the
thicket, where he would fast for seven days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
And there he prayed that in some way which
the Great Spirit would show him, he might
bring a great blessing to his people and make
their lives less hard. He knew full well that
most of his comrades prayed that they might
become great warriors, or that they should be
mighty men of the chase. But Wunzh prayed
not for these.</p>

<p>For four days he fasted and prayed, and each
day he grew weaker from lack of food, but his
faith and his courage grew stronger.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, as he lay upon his bed of
skins, there appeared outside the door of his
tepee a strong, bright youth, clad all in shimmering
greens and golden yellows, and wearing
upon his head a plume of waving green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried the youth, &ldquo;let us wrestle, and
see who shall overcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Wunzh sprang from his bed, for though
his body was weak, his spirit was strong, and
he grappled with the youth and they wrestled
together.</p>

<p>At length the youth said, &ldquo;That will do for
to-day. You have wrestled well, though neither
of us has overcome. I will return to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36em;">
<a name="plate07" id="plate07"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/plate07.png" width="576" height="800"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;HE GRAPPLED WITH THE YOUTH AND THEY
WRESTLED TOGETHER&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And no sooner had he finished speaking than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
he vanished from the sight of Wunzh who
dropped exhausted upon his bed.</p>

<p>The next day, at exactly the same hour, the
youth came again, and so suddenly that it
seemed to Wunzh he must have dropped from
the sky.</p>

<p>Wunzh had less strength in his body than
on the previous day, but he felt sure the stranger
had been sent by the Great Spirit, and so he
grappled with him again and wrestled well.</p>

<p>But as Wunzh&rsquo;s strength was nearly gone, the
young man said once more, &ldquo;That will do for
to-day. To-morrow I will return. &rsquo;Tis the last
day of your fast. Be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the stranger disappeared, and Wunzh,
trembling with weakness of body, prayed the
Great Spirit that he might yet overcome. And
as he prayed he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Then, as Wunzh slept, he dreamed. And it
seemed to him that he again wrestled with the
strange youth, and he overcame and threw him
to the ground. And a voice spoke to him and
said: &ldquo;Strip off the clothing of the youth and
wear it for your own. Bury his body, and protect
the spot where he is buried. Make the earth
soft and mellow; keep it clear of weeds; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
water it day by day. Do all this, and your
prayer to the Great Spirit shall be answered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wunzh slept long, but when he wakened he
remembered his dream and the words that had
been spoken.</p>

<p>That morning his father came to the tepee to
offer food, but Wunzh said, &ldquo;Let me alone until
the evening.&rdquo; So his father went away.</p>

<p>At the same hour, on this day, the stranger
once more appeared outside the door of the
tepee, and once more Wunzh went forth to
wrestle. He was weaker than before, but his
dream had given him such courage that he
grasped the strange youth and with a supreme
effort threw him prostrate upon the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have overcome,&rdquo; cried Wunzh, for the
youth lay dead at his feet.</p>

<p>Then Wunzh stripped off his clothing as he
had been told in his dream, and he dressed himself
in the garments of green and yellow, and
he placed the plume of green upon his head.</p>

<p>Then, kneeling, he tenderly buried the body
of the youth, and his tears fell as he did so, for
he said, &ldquo;He was my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Wunzh returned to the tepee of his
father he was received with great rejoicing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
given food. His new clothing was looked upon
in wonder, but he did not tell its story.</p>

<p>Day by day he went to the little spot of
ground where his own little tepee had been,
and he kept the earth soft and moist and free
from weeds.</p>

<p>And after many days had gone by, green
plumes came up through the earth; and they
grew, and became sturdy stalks.</p>

<p>And still they grew, and after many days and
weeks the broad green leaves held ears of juicy
grain.</p>

<p>Day by day the ears grew full and the grain
ripened; the green plumes at their ends turned
to yellow, and then to brown, and the ground
was covered with the many stalks.</p>

<p>Then Wunzh said to his father, &ldquo;Come with
me. I have something to show you.&rdquo; And his
father went with him, and he showed him the
clearing where his tepee had stood. And it was
all a field of green and yellow, like the clothing
which Wunzh had worn, when he came from his
fast.</p>

<p>Then he told his father of the stranger&rsquo;s visit,
and of his dream, and of his overcoming the
youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>&ldquo;And now, my father,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the Great
Spirit has answered my prayer. From this time
on life will be less hard for the Indian, for he
shall have other food than game and fish. The
Great Spirit has caused this grain to grow, and
it is good for man to eat. Taste it, my father,
and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is the story the Red Men tell of the
gift of the maize, or Indian corn.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>THE STARS THAT DANCE<br />
<br />
(Iroquois)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY years ago in the Indian country a
company of eleven young men went out
from the village of their fathers. They were
going to prepare themselves for the war dances,
and for battle with their foes.</p>

<p>Away into the forest they went, but before
they left the lodges of their people, their leader
said, &ldquo;You, our parents, must prepare food,
that we may have strength for the trial that is
before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they went away, singing the war songs
of their nation, while their leader beat upon
the water drum to give them courage and
endurance.</p>

<p>On they marched until they came to the
part of the forest where they were to begin
their training, and there they stopped and prepared
a rude lodge for shelter.</p>

<p>Many days they stayed, practising the light
step of the hunter which falls as softly as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
falling leaf, or dancing the war dance to the
beating of the drum.</p>

<p>But at length they grew weary and faint,
for day after day had passed, and no food had
been sent them from the lodges of their fathers.</p>

<p>Then their leader sent one of their number
back to the village, and he told the people that
the young men were faint and weary, and in
need of food. Yet the people sent them no
food, and the young man went back, weak, and
empty-handed.</p>

<p>Once more the young men began their dancing,
for their hearts were full of courage, and
Indian youths are strong to endure. Then, once
more, they sent to the people asking for food,
but still no food was given them.</p>

<p>Then a third time they sent, and yet in vain.</p>

<p>That night, as the youths slept, quite exhausted,
in their lodge, their leader was awakened
by the sound of singing. Slow, and soft,
and alluring were the voices; and they seemed
far above the earth.</p>

<p>The leader wakened his companions, and
together they listened. Then, one by one, the
young men arose, and new strength seemed to
come into their limbs, and new courage into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
their hearts, and dancing, they followed the
sound of the singing. On and on they went,
and then they seemed to be lifted from off the
earth, but still they danced as higher and higher
they arose. Now they were past the tree tops,
now they were above the mountain tops, and
now high up among the clouds. And still they
danced the war dance of their nation, faster
and faster, as the music led them on.</p>

<p>The Night Wind saw them. &ldquo;They follow
the song of the Sky Witches,&rdquo; he cried in alarm,
and he hastened to overtake them and turn
them back. But they paid no heed to the Night
Wind, for the song of the Sky Witches had
charmed them, and they followed on dancing.</p>

<p>The people of their village caught sight of
them as they passed far over their heads, and
they ran from their lodges and called to them.
&ldquo;Come back! Come back!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Look
down upon us, and the spell will be broken.
Heed not the song of the Sky Witches!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But still the young men followed on,&mdash;all but
one, their leader, who, hearing the voice of his
mother, turned his head and looked back. The
spell of the Sky Witches was broken, and down,
down he sped to the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>The other ten followed on, and the Mother
Moon, quite dizzy with the sight of their dancing,
turned aside from her steady course and
begged them to heed her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sky Witches are seeking victims for
their feasts,&rdquo; she warned them. &ldquo;Turn away;
turn away! They will destroy you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet in spite of her warning the witchery of
the music led the youths on. And then the
Mother Moon cried, &ldquo;I will save you from their
wicked spell in spite of yourselves!&rdquo; With that
she waved her girdle of vapors, and the ten
youths were changed into fixed stars, and set
forever in the heavens.</p>

<p>Seven of the youths were large and strong,
and three were small and less sturdy; and so
they were as stars. When the people of their
village looked once more up into the sky, they
saw seven bright stars dancing and twinkling
above them. But those whose eyes were very
strong, when the night was clear, could see ten.</p>

<p>And to this day these stars still dance and
twinkle in the heavens&mdash;and this is the Indian
legend of their origin.</p>

<p>We call these stars the Pleiades, but the
Indians call them &ldquo;The Stars That Dance.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>THE PUKWUDJEE AND THE
MORNING STAR<br />
<br />
(Ojibwa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, in the Indian country,
two children were left alone in a village.
All the other people had gone to a far-away
country.</p>

<p>The sister, who was the older, thought, &ldquo;I
must take good care of my baby brother,&rdquo;
though she was not much more than a baby
herself. And this she did. She cooked food
for him, and she made him little moccasins, and
crooned a song for him when it was time for
him to sleep.</p>

<p>She grew up rapidly, but the baby brother
seemed scarcely to grow at all. He became
strong and sturdy, however, though he was so
small a mite.</p>

<p>The sister watched over him carefully, and as
soon as he could run about she made him a
tiny bow and arrows, and taught him how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
shoot. At the same time she hung a shell about
his neck, for a charm, and she named him He-of-the-Little-Shell.</p>

<p>For all his small size, he soon learned to use
the bow and arrow, and his aim was very true.
He brought home birds and squirrels for food,
and after a time he was able to bring down
bigger game, so that they fared very well.</p>

<p>But He-of-the-Little-Shell did not grow. When
he stood beside his sister he looked no bigger
than a squirrel.</p>

<p>While the boy was out hunting, his sister
busied herself about their lodge, but she looked
often toward the east, for she loved the clouds
and the sky and the morning sun. She was
always outside the lodge in the early morning,
that she might watch the sunrise, for she thought
the eastern sky more beautiful than any other
part of the heavens.</p>

<p>So the two lived on very happily, for the little
brother was a merry fellow, full of tricks
and mischief.</p>

<p>One morning, as he was hunting, he saw a
man fishing for beaver through a hole in the
ice. He watched him, and when the man had
caught several he loaded them upon a sled which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
he drew away. He-of-the-Little-Shell followed.
He ran up close to the load and, with a slash
of his shell, cut off the tail of one of the beavers,
and ran away home with it.</p>

<p>For several days he played the same trick,
and the man was very much puzzled to know
how it was that one of his beavers always lost
its tail before he reached home. At length He-of-the-Little-Shell
followed the man home, and
when the beavers were unloaded he stepped out
and spoke to the man.</p>

<p>The hunter was astonished to see so tiny a
fellow. &ldquo;Is it you who has cut my beavers&rsquo;
tails?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered He-of-the-Little-Shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a mind to kill you!&rdquo; exclaimed the
hunter, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you could not do it,&rdquo; said the boy
quickly, and before the man could think, he had
disappeared.</p>

<p>One day when he came home from the hunt
he said to his sister, &ldquo;The time has come when
I must go away from our lodge. I must go to
the mountains and live among the rocks and
caves. That is my true home, for I am a Pukwudjee,&mdash;a
little man of the mountains. But,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
he added, &ldquo;I shall not leave you here alone.
You shall go to the home you would love best
of all. Tell we where it shall be.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Then the sister answered, &ldquo;I love the eastern
sky best of all. I should love to live there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be so,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;I
will go up the mountain, where the little people
dwell. You shall be carried to the eastern sky;
the four winds of heaven shall lift you. I will
look up often and see you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said his sister, &ldquo;will look down upon
you and watch over you every morning. When
you see the rosy clouds you will say, &lsquo;My sister
is painting her face&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They bade each other good-bye, and He-of-the-Little-Shell
ran up the mountain side, for he
was a Pukwudjee, a &ldquo;little man of the mountains,&rdquo;
as the Indians call them.</p>

<p>The four winds of heaven carried the sister
to the eastern sky, where she became the Morning
Star, and there she watches over her brother
and all his people.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>THE WHITE HAWK<br />
<br />
(Shawnee)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>AUPEE was an Indian youth, and a mighty
hunter. The meaning of his name was
White Hawk. He was tall, and strong as the
great oaks of the forest. He was fleet of foot,
and keen of sight. When he drew his bow, his
arrow went swiftly to the mark.</p>

<p>The Chief of the tribe said, &ldquo;White Hawk
will provide well for the maiden he chooses as
his wife. He has the flesh of every animal for
food. He has the skin of every animal for his
lodge and for his clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Waupee lived alone in his lodge. He
loved the chase, but as yet he cared for no
maiden.</p>

<p>One day, as he followed a deer through the
forest, he went far away from his lodge; far
away from his usual hunting ground. Beyond
the forest he saw an open space where the grass
grew green, and yellow blossoms studded it like
stars in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>Waupee passed swiftly through the forest
until he came to the open space, and there, as
he looked about, he discovered a curious thing.
It was a circle, where the grass bent down as
though many feet had passed lightly over it.
He wondered what dancing feet could have made
this circle in the grass. And he wondered still
more when he looked all about and could find no
trace of a footstep outside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did they come? How did they go?&rdquo;
questioned Waupee in amazement. &ldquo;I must
know more of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he hid himself among the trees in the edge
of the forest and waited.</p>

<p>He had hunted long: the drowsy insects droned
about him, and at length Waupee fell asleep.
Soon he was aroused by the sound of tinkling
music. It was like the ringing of a silver bell.</p>

<p>He started up and listened. It seemed to
come from the sky. He looked up; then he
stood still and waited.</p>

<p>Directly over the circle upon the prairie
grass there was descending something&mdash;Waupee
knew not what. It was like a boat, but its
colors were like the colors of a sea shell, changing
from silver to green, to pink, and to blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>The wonderful boat came to rest in the center
of the circle, and out of it stepped twelve
maidens, more beautiful than any Waupee had
seen before.</p>

<p>Taking hold of hands, they danced lightly
round and round, while the silver bells kept
time to their steps. Their eyes were bright as
the stars, and a star rested upon the breast of
each maiden. But though all were beautiful,
Waupee was attracted by one alone, and she
was the youngest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have this maiden for my own!&rdquo; cried
Waupee. He ran from the shelter of the trees
and would have clasped her in his arms, but he
was too late.</p>

<p>The startled maidens sprang into their boat,
which lifted instantly and carried them away.</p>

<p>Waupee watched until they disappeared
among the clouds. Then slowly he returned to
his lodge, but he could think only of the beautiful
maiden with eyes like stars, and he determined
to use all his powers to win her.</p>

<p>The next day, at the same hour, he was again
at the edge of the forest, but this time he had
changed to the form of the white hawk, whose
name he bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>&ldquo;I will wait until they dance,&rdquo; he said to
himself, &ldquo;and then I will fly to the maiden of
my choice. I will change to my own form and
clasp her in my arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Waupee waited, and as before he heard
music like the tinkling of silver bells, and the
boat with its changing silvery colors floated
down within the circle.</p>

<p>Out stepped the twelve maidens and began
their dance.</p>

<p>Waupee was too eager to wait, and he flew
at once from the tree. But the moment the
maidens heard the sound of his wings, they
sprang into their boat and were carried swiftly
back to the sky.</p>

<p>Waupee, resuming his form as a man, sat
down in the forest, and drew his blanket over
his head, as the Indians do when they mourn.
He feared that the maidens would nevermore
return.</p>

<p>But after a time his courage and hope came
back, and he determined that he would not give
up until he had captured the maiden who had
won his heart.</p>

<p>On the third day he was again at the edge of
the forest, and there he noticed the half-decayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
stump of a tree. In and out, about the stump,
a dozen field mice were playing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must help me, little brothers,&rdquo;
said Waupee. He lifted the stump and set it
down near the magic circle in the field. The
little field mice continued to play about it as
before. Waupee changed himself into the form
of a field mouse, and began running about with
the others.</p>

<p>He soon heard the tinkling music, and looking
up saw once more the silvery boat floating
down from the sky.</p>

<p>When it touched the earth the star maidens
sprang out and began their dance. But one of
them saw the old stump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not there before!&rdquo; she cried, and
running from the circle she looked closely at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us return!&rdquo; said the youngest maiden,
but the others replied, &ldquo;But look! Here are
field mice running about. Let us chase them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little mice ran in all directions, and the
maidens ran after them, laughing, and threatening
them with their silver wands.</p>

<p>And the one that the youngest maiden chased
ran far from the others. Then, just as the
maiden reached him, and would have struck him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
with her wand, the little field mouse changed
suddenly to the form of a man,&mdash;and it was
Waupee.</p>

<p>He caught the maiden in his arms, and he told
her how she had won his heart by her loveliness,
and begged her to stay with him.</p>

<p>The other maidens, frightened at the sight of
Waupee, sprang into their boat, and it rose and
bore them away.</p>

<p>Then the youngest maiden wept, but Waupee
comforted her, for he was strong and brave, and
a mighty hunter. And her heart was won, and
she went with him to the village.</p>

<p>So Waupee was wedded to the Star Maiden,
and she was the loveliest maiden in all the
tribe.</p>

<p>The next year Waupee and his bride were
made still happier by the coming of a baby boy,
and the White Hawk was the proudest father
in all the tribe.</p>

<p>But after many moons had passed, the Star
Maiden grew lonely for her father, and for the
scenes of her star home in the sky. And so,
one day, she took her little son by the hand and
led him to the magic circle in the grass of the
prairie. In the center of the circle she placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
a boat which she had woven from the grass and
rushes of the meadow, and she and her little son
stepped into it.
Then she sang the
song of the silvery
bells which had
been always in her
heart, and the boat
of woven rushes
began to rise.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;WAUPEE HEARD THE STRAINS
OF THE MAGIC SONG&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Up and up it
went until it carried
the Star
Maiden and her son far away to the Sky Land.</p>

<p>Waupee, far away at the chase, heard the
strains of the magic song and ran to the spot,
but he was too late. He saw the boat with its
occupants disappear among the clouds, and then
he sat down upon the prairie, covered his head
with his blanket, and mourned. And no one in
all the tribe could comfort him.</p>

<p>The Star Maiden and her son were welcomed
by her father, and for some time they were
happy. Then the boy began to long for his
father, the White Hawk, who was so strong and
brave. And his mother, too, secretly longed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
Waupee and the home he had made for her.</p>

<p>One day her father, who had noticed, said to
her, &ldquo;Go, my daughter, back to the Earth country.
Tell your husband that I want him to visit
me in the land of stars, and bring him here to
dwell with you and your son. But before he
comes have him shoot one of every kind of bird
and beast, and bring a specimen of each to our
Sky Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Star Maiden gladly took her son and
stepped into her boat. Then singing the magic
song which was always in her heart, they were
carried back to Earth.</p>

<p>Waupee&rsquo;s heart leaped up like a deer when
he heard the music of the song, and running to
the magic circle he clasped his wife and his son
in his strong, loving arms.</p>

<p>The Star Maiden gave him the message from
her father, and though Waupee loved the forests
and the prairies, he prepared to go to the
Sky Land. He hunted day after day, and from
each bird or animal that he shot he cut a wing,
or a foot, or a tail, to carry with him. At last
he was ready, and with the Star Maiden and
their son, he stepped into the magic boat and
was carried far up to the land of stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>All the people of that far-off country gathered
to greet him, and to welcome the return
of the Star Maiden and her boy. Her father
took the great bundle of strange objects that
Waupee had brought, and he said to his people:
&ldquo;Come, I will let you choose! Those of you who
wish to stay in the Star Land may remain as
you are. The others may select one object from
this strange bundle, and according to your
choice, so shall you be in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the people crowded forward, and one
took the tail of a deer, and immediately he was
changed into a deer, and bounded away to the
Earth country. Another took the claw of a
bear, and at once he became a bear, and shuffled
off to find his way to the Earth. And so it was
with the choice of every one. Some became
birds and flew away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Waupee, to the Star Maiden,
&ldquo;let me choose the wing of the White Hawk,
and do you the same, and our son. Then we
may visit both the Earth and the Sky, and be
always together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they chose. And so they have lived, ever
since.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>HOW MOSQUITOES CAME TO BE<br />
<br />
(Iroquois)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the long-ago time, the Red Men tell us that
their fathers were greatly troubled by the
visits of an enormous bird called Mosquito. No
one knew whence it came, or where it went.
But always it brought terror and destruction.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would fly over the growing corn
and with the great force of its wings beat it all
to the earth. Sometimes it would swoop down
and strike a child playing beside the lodge.
Again it would come swiftly and throw a man
or a woman of the tribe to the earth, and leave
them bleeding and torn.</p>

<p>At length its visits became so frequent that
the people were afraid to leave their lodges, and
so a great council was called, to see what could
be done to get rid of the monster.</p>

<p>At this council one of the young braves
said, &ldquo;I will go out and try to snare the bird.
I will offer my life to save my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;WITH A TERRIBLE CRY THE GREAT MOSQUITO FLEW DOWN
WITH HIS ENORMOUS WINGS OUTSTRETCHED&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The young man cut strong bands of rawhide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
He said, &ldquo;I will try to throw one of these bands
about the great bird, and snare him before he
ends my life. Then you must come and kill
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the young brave started out, and when he
reached a bare place on the mountain side he
sat down on the ground and sang his death-song
while he waited.</p>

<p>Presently, with a terrible cry, the great Mosquito
flew down with his enormous wings outstretched,
and just as he buried his talons in
the young warrior&rsquo;s flesh, the brave youth
sprang erect, threw one of the rawhide thongs
about the foot of the bird and bound him to the
rock.</p>

<p>The men of the tribe who had watched the
conflict ran to the mountain side and let fly
their arrows. Soon the great Mosquito lay
dead upon the rocks.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the village. The
news was spread by runners, so that braves
both young and old came from neighboring
tribes to see the body of the monstrous bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body should be burned,&rdquo; counseled one
of the old men of the tribe; but so proud were
they of the young warrior who had given his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
life to free the Red Men of this great foe, and
so eager were they to show the huge size of the
monster, that they gave no heed to his advice.</p>

<p>One day they noticed that small stinging flies
began to buzz about. Nothing like them had
ever been seen before. Their number increased,
and then the people noticed that they came from
the body of the great bird. And the insects bit
and stung them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a new plague,&rdquo; said the Indians. &ldquo;We
should have given heed to the counsel of the old
man of the tribe, and burned the body, for
we know that all evil things are cleansed by
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the little stinging insects were called
mosquitoes, and to this day they are a trouble
and an annoyance to mankind.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>HOW BIRDS AND FAIRIES CAME TO BE<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE&mdash;oh, a very long time ago&mdash;there were
no birds and no fairies upon the earth.
Now I will tell you a story of their beginning,
as the Indian grandmothers tell it to the Red
children.</p>

<p>Ten beautiful sisters lived in the lodge of
their father, and no maidens in all the tribe
were so good to look upon as they.</p>

<p>Young warriors came and sought them in
marriage, and one by one the sisters went away
to the lodges of their husbands, until only one
was left in the lodge of her father.</p>

<p>This one was Oweenee, the youngest of all,
and the most beautiful. Many warriors had
sought her favor, but she was not easily won.
Her sisters mocked her, but she cared not for
that. &ldquo;I shall know when the right suitor
comes,&rdquo; she said to her own heart, and went
about her duties in her father&rsquo;s lodge.</p>

<p>One day an old man came to the lodge door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
and talked with the youngest sister, and though
he seemed old and bent with years, her heart told
her, &ldquo;He is the one for whom you have waited.&rdquo;
And so, when he asked her to go to his lodge
and be his wife, she consented.</p>

<p>Her sisters mocked her more than before, but
they and their husbands went with Oweenee
and the old man along the path.</p>

<p>The married sisters led the way, and the old
man, whose name was Osseo, and the youngest
sister, Oweenee, walked behind, and the girl was
kind and thoughtful, and watched the steps of
Osseo with care.</p>

<p>But what was her surprise, as they were
about to pass a hollow log, to see him suddenly
dart into its open end and almost immediately
come from the farther end&mdash;not old and bent,
but the youngest, the strongest, and the most
active of all the warriors in the company. Then
he took the hand of the youngest sister, and
together they led the way to his lodge.</p>

<p>The eyes of the youngest sister were bright
with happiness, but the older sisters were dumb
with astonishment.</p>

<p>When they entered the lodge of Osseo, they
found a feast prepared. The food was plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
and the dishes were of wood. The lodge, too,
seemed shabby and poor. But while they ate,
the lodge began gently to rise from the ground.
Up and up it went, and its shabby sides began
to gleam like silver. The food became the richest
and choicest, and the dishes became like
shells of radiant colors.</p>

<p>Up and up the lodge continued to go, until
at last it reached the Sky Land, and stopped
before the doorway of the Evening Star.</p>

<p>The Evening Star greeted them and spoke to
Osseo. Then the sisters and their husbands,
who had scoffed at Oweenee, knew that the old
man whom she had married was no other than
Osseo, the Son of the Evening Star.</p>

<p>And Evening Star said, &ldquo;You and your beautiful
bride are welcome to my lodge, but these
others who have scoffed at her and at you may
not come inside. They may stay at the lodge
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the lodge of Osseo became a wonderful
silver cage, and the sisters and their husbands
were changed into singing birds, with plumage
of brightest colors, blue, and red, and orange,
and scarlet. And they flew about in their silver
cage, and sang to Osseo and his bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>Now Osseo grew stronger and more manly
day by day, and his bride grew sweeter and
lovelier to look upon. After many moons had
come and gone there came to Osseo and his
wife a little son. As the boy grew he seemed
brighter than the starlight, and Osseo and
Oweenee loved him dearly; but his grandfather,
the Evening Star, loved him best of all.</p>

<p>One day Evening Star said to Osseo, &ldquo;You
must be careful not to let the light beams from
the small Star that dwells near by fall upon
the cage of singing birds, or upon yourself, or
your wife, or your son. The Star is an evil
spirit, and the light beams are his enchanted
arrows. They change the form of all those upon
whom they fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Osseo promised to be careful. But after
many moons had passed, he forgot about the
light beams of the Star neighbor.</p>

<p>He made a bow and arrows for his little son,
who loved to play at shooting. Then one day
the boy said, &ldquo;I want to shoot some living thing.
How shall I learn to be a hunter if I have no
game to shoot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will open the silver cage,&rdquo; said Osseo,
&ldquo;and you may shoot at the flying birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>Then the little boy was pleased, and he drew
his bow, and Osseo opened the door of the cage.</p>

<p>Out flew the birds, glad to stretch their wings,
and the boy sped his arrow after them. But
swifter than his arrow was the light beam of
the little Star, and it fell upon the birds and
the boy.</p>

<p>Immediately they became enchanted. The
birds flew swiftly down to earth and lighted
upon an island in the midst of a green sea, and
the little boy, the grandson of Evening Star,
floated softly down after them.</p>

<p>Then Osseo was full of sorrow, and he said
to his father, &ldquo;Oh, father! let us go also, my
wife and I, that we may not be separated from
our son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Evening Star permitted Osseo and Oweenee
to enter the silver cage, and silver wings
were given it, and it flew down to the island in
the midst of the green sea.</p>

<p>And then the enchantment of the little Star
changed all of them to Fairies, and joining
hands they danced and sang in the starlight,
while the Evening Star looked down upon them
from his far-away home in the sky.</p>

it is good that you should hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking her basket upon her knees and continuing
her weaving, the grandmother told her
story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many, many moons ago there was a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
warrior who was lonely in his father&rsquo;s lodge,
and he said to himself, &lsquo;I will seek a maiden
to wed, and make ready a lodge of my own.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he watched the maidens of the village,
and he found two sisters who seemed so modest,
and kind, and good, that he knew not which
of them to choose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he went to their father&rsquo;s lodge, he
was kindly treated by both. They gave him
words of welcome, they smiled upon him, and
they prepared food and set it before him. Both
could weave fine baskets for the lodge, and
make rich embroidery of quills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many times the young brave went to the
lodge, but he could not tell which maiden would
make the better wife. And at last he said to
himself, &lsquo;I will try magic. I will get the medicine
man to help me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he visited the lodge of the Medicine
Man, and after a time there came away from
the Medicine Man&rsquo;s lodge an old man, bent, and
leaning upon a stick. He walked feebly, and
his garments were ragged. His hair was white,
and his chin quivered with age.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE OLDER SISTER LOOKED ON WITH SCORN&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The old man went to the lodge of the two
maidens and begged a bit of food. The younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
sister asked him to come inside the lodge and
rest. Then she prepared some nourishing food
and gave to him, and while he ate it she noticed
that his feet were barely covered with
pieces of skins tied about the ankle. She hastened
to finish the moccasins that she was embroidering,
and gave them to him, so that his
feet should not be bruised with walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The older sister looked on with scorn, and
made unkind remarks. She asked her sister
why she should spend time upon a forlorn old
man who could never repay her. She laughed
at his ragged garments and at his quivering
chin and feeble knees. Then in a sharp voice
she bade him begone before her lover should
come from the hunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man went away, after thanking the
younger sister for her kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A short time later, the young warrior came
to the door of the lodge, bearing upon his shoulders
a deer which he had shot. Both sisters
smiled at him and bade him enter. He passed
the older sister without a glance, and laid the
deer at the feet of the younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As they looked down at the deer, both sisters
discovered that the young man had upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
his feet the moccasins that the younger sister
had just given to the strange old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I seek a maiden to be the light of my
lodge,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and by magic I have found that
one. I was the old man who came hither for
shelter and comfort, and so I learned how to
escape a sharp tongue and bitter words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But the Medicine Man&rsquo;s charm has not yet
finished its work,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;I do not want
another to suffer the fate I have so narrowly
escaped.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the younger sister by the hand and
led her from the lodge. The older sister followed,
and as she stepped outside, her feet became
rooted to the ground, and she was turned
into an aspen tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The younger sister became the light of the
young warrior&rsquo;s lodge; but the aspen tree, like
the older sister, while beautiful to look upon,
has since that day had a whispering and unruly
tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>WHY THE BABY SAYS &ldquo;GOO&rdquo;<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY, many moons ago there lived among
the Red people a warrior who was greatly
respected and admired by all his tribe.</p>

<p>When an enemy came to attack them, this
warrior was always the first to resist. His arm
was strong, and his arrows went true and
straight to the mark. He had gone alone on
many a daring hunt, and had contended with
the fiercest beasts of the forest and slain them.
But greatest of all, he had fought alone with
mighty giants, and overcome them, so that his
tribe was rid of their evil magic. It was no
wonder that the people thought him great.</p>

<p>But then, as so often follows, the warrior became
puffed up with thoughts of his own courage
and power, and he was filled with pride,
and boastings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no one, among men or beasts,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;who does not fear me. All men obey me.
They tremble at the sound of my voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>Now there was in the tribe of this warrior an
old grandmother to whom age had given great
wisdom. And she thought within her heart,
&ldquo;Our warrior is becoming puffed up. He thinks
too well of himself. It would be good for him
to be humbled.&rdquo; So among the women she
said, &ldquo;There is one whom I know, who is
greater than the mighty warrior. <em>He</em> would
not tremble at his voice, nor obey his word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This saying was repeated to the men of the
tribe, and in time it came to the ears of the
great warrior himself. Immediately he went
to the lodge of the grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this, that I hear?&rdquo; he enquired.
&ldquo;Show me who it is that will not obey my
voice! Tell me his name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Wasis,&rdquo; replied the grandmother,
&ldquo;and he sits inside my lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warrior threw back the hanging of deer
skin covering the entrance of the lodge, and
strode within. There, upon the ground, sucking
a piece of maple sugar, sat Wasis, the baby.
The warrior looked at him in surprise. He
knew nothing about babies, having been too
busy all his life with battles and adventures
to pay any attention to the little people of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
tribe. But here was just a tiny fellow. It
would be no trouble to get him to obey!</p>

<p>So without any ado, the warrior said, &ldquo;Ho,
baby, come here to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baby looked at him, but did not move.
He repeated his command. The baby stopped
sucking his maple sugar long enough to say
&ldquo;Goo, goo,&rdquo; but he did not move.</p>

<p>Then the warrior said, &ldquo;I will show him that
I am to be feared, and then he will obey me.&rdquo;
So he began a war dance, and uttered fierce war
cries, and Wasis opened his mouth and sent
forth such piercing yells and shrieks, that the
warrior stopped in amazement. And when he
had stopped the baby began sucking his maple
sugar again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, baby, come here to me!&rdquo; he repeated
once more, but at that the baby again opened
his mouth and cried so lustily that the great
warrior covered his ears and ran from the lodge.
&ldquo;It is worse than the war cries of the Frost
Giants!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he obey you?&rdquo; asked the grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the warrior. &ldquo;He is a little fellow,
but he is mightier than I.&rdquo;</p>

the baby, conquers us all, and no one can resist
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the baby, left alone in the lodge with his
maple sugar, stopped now and then to say,
&ldquo;Goo, goo!&rdquo; For had he not conquered the
mighty warrior, the great brave of the tribe?</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>WHY THE SQUIRREL COUGHS<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> GREAT trickster was Manabozho. He
loved to play jokes upon his friends of the
forest.</p>

<p>One day he invited them all to a feast in his
wigwam. And every one came, from the woodpecker
and the tiny mouse, to the great moose
with branching horns.</p>

<p>It was a time of scarcity of food, and all were
glad to be asked to a banquet.</p>

<p>But the meat that Manabozho had ready for
his guests, he had prepared by magic&mdash;though
of that no one knew except himself.</p>

<p>When all had assembled, Manabozho gave to
each a portion of meat. The woodpecker was
the first to taste of his, and as he took the
delicious looking morsel in his mouth, it turned
to ashes on his tongue, so that he was choked
and began to cough. But the meat looked so
good, and he was so hungry that he tasted again,
and again it turned to ashes and choked him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>Every guest had the same experience. The
little mouse, the otter, the badger, the fox, the
wolf, and even the moose tasted his portion and
it turned to ashes on his tongue.</p>

<p>In vain the guests tried to be courteous and
to stifle their coughing, but it grew worse and
worse as first one and then another ate of the
meat.</p>

<p>At length there was such a deafening noise
in the wigwam, caused by the chorus of coughing
and strangling from so many throats great
and small, that Manabozho picked up a club in
pretended anger. Threatening them with it, he
drove them out of doors, where he changed them
all to squirrels.</p>

<p>And that, the Indians tell us, is the reason
that the squirrel coughs.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>WHY THE FROGS CROAK<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>O-O-O-O-RE, mo-o-o-o-re!&rdquo; croaked a big
frog in the marshes. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis enough,
&rsquo;tis enough, &rsquo;tis enough!&rdquo; answered a smaller
frog.</p>

<p>But the big frog called again, &ldquo;Mo-o-o-o-re,
mo-o-o-o-re!&rdquo; And again the smaller frog answered,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis enough! &rsquo;Tis enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it the frogs are quarreling about,
grandmother?&rdquo; asked a little Indian girl, and
the grandmother replied, &ldquo;About the water, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they quarrel about the water? Is
it a story, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the grandmother, &ldquo;it is a story.
Listen and I will tell it to you!</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the long-time-ago all the waters of the
land were tied up. The Indian people grew
thirsty, and more thirsty. Their fields were
drying up. The flowers withered. The people
said, &lsquo;We shall die!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>&ldquo;Then there came to one of the villages the
giant, Rabbit, and he said, &lsquo;What is this I hear
about the waters being tied up?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chief answered, &lsquo;For many days there
has been no water. The streams are empty.
No little rivers come down the mountain side.
Our corn is drying up. Our people&rsquo;s throats
are parched.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The giant, Rabbit, said, &lsquo;I will go into the
mountains and see who has tied up the water.&rsquo;
Then he strode away, taking such great steps
that he was out of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up the mountain went the giant, and when
he came to the top he found a tribe of men
there, and they had tied up the water so that
it stood in great pools which had grown green
and slimy, because it was no longer fresh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doing with the water?&rsquo; asked
the Rabbit, and his voice rolled down the mountain
like thunder. &lsquo;Do you not know that the
tribes below you are dying for want of it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chief of the strange tribe came out to
answer the Rabbit. He was fat and ugly, and
his back was covered with green slime from the
pool.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35.187em;">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;HE WAS FAT AND UGLY, AND HIS BACK WAS COVERED

</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We need the water for ourselves. It was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
running away down the mountain, so we stopped
it,&rsquo; said the Chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rabbit reached out and caught the Chief by
the back of his neck and shook him. The
giant&rsquo;s grasp was strong, and the Chief&rsquo;s eyes
bulged from his head, and he swelled up till
he was puffed out all over, from trying to get
his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So shall you look, you and all your tribe,
hereafter,&rsquo; said Rabbit, holding him off and
looking at him. Then he threw him into the
green pool, and all his tribe with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that Rabbit untied the water, and all
the little streams began to flow down the mountain.
Our people, at the foot of the mountain,
saw them coming, and they gave thanks to the
Great Spirit, because he had helped the giant,
Rabbit, to give them water again, that they
might live.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tribe at the top of the mountain became
frogs, as you see them now, and they have
traveled to many parts of the land; but wherever
they go they keep on quarreling about the
water, as you have heard them this day.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
(California Tribes)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>WO small Indian boys were seated before
the tepee fashioning bows and arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is not good!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the
boys, throwing aside the stick with which he had
been working. &ldquo;Besides, I am tired of sitting
still. Let us go for a swim in the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away they dashed, running swiftly, as the
Indian child is taught to run. Into the water
they jumped, swimming, diving, splashing, and
stopping now and then for a water battle.</p>

<p>At length they had had enough of the water,
so out upon the bank they came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us climb upon this rock to dry ourselves.
Its top is flat, and the sun is warm upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they climbed upon the flat rock, and in a
few moments both boys were fast asleep. Then
a strange thing began to occur. The rock slowly
and gradually commenced to stretch itself up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
up, up, higher, and higher, and higher. And
the boys continued to sleep.</p>

<p>Taller, and taller grew the rock, carrying the
boys upward on its flat surface until at last
their faces were bathed by the clouds that floated
in the sky. And still they slept.</p>

<p>For many moons they slept; for a whole snow.</p>

<p>In the meantime the people of their village
missed them and began to search. They
searched by the river, and in the forest, but no
one could find the missing boys. There was
great sorrow in the village.</p>

<p>None of the people knew of the great rock.
Only the animals knew.</p>

<p>Then one day the animals came together, and
they said, &ldquo;What is to be done? The people are
sorrowing because of the boys that are lost. Can
we not return them to their friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the animals decided to try to get the boys
off the great rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are littlest,&rdquo; said the lion to the mouse,
&ldquo;you try first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the mouse made ready and sprang as high
as she could up the side of the rock. Just a
hand-breadth she jumped, and fell back into the
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>So the rat tried next, and he made a mighty
effort, and jumped two hand-breadths, and then
he too fell back into the valley.</p>

<p>Alter that every sort of animal jumped in
turn, the otter, and the badger, the fox, and the
wolf, and the bear, and though each one jumped
as high as he could, he jumped only against the
side of the rock, and went tumbling back into
the valley.</p>

<p>Last of all came the lion. With a mighty roar
he sprang&mdash;but it was of no use: he too struck
the side of the great rock and fell back with the
others.</p>

<p>They were about to give up and go back to
their homes in the river and in the forest, when
a tiny measuring-worm came creeping over the
grass. &ldquo;By your leave,&rdquo; she said quite humbly,
addressing the lion, &ldquo;I should like to try and
see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho,&rdquo; laughed all the animals together.
&ldquo;Ho-ho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But without waiting for their consent, the
measuring-worm made her way slowly to the
foot of the great rock, and then, little by little,
little by little, she drew herself up, up, up the
side of the mighty rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>Up, and up, and up she went, until she was
lost to sight of the animals waiting below.</p>

<p>At last she reached the top, and drew herself
over the edge. And there lay the two boys, still
sleeping.</p>

<p>Then the measuring-worm took the two boys,
and started back. She climbed with them down
the side of the rock, little by little, down, and
down, and down.</p>

<p>At last she came within sight of the waiting
animals.</p>

<p>Down, and down still she climbed until she
was in their midst.</p>

<p>So mighty was the noise made by the assembled
animals that it wakened the sleeping boys,
and brought the men and women of the village
to the foot of the great rock.</p>

<p>And so the boys were restored to their people.</p>

<p>But the great rock with its almost perpendicular
sides stands to-day, lofty and imposing.</p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>HOW THE FLYING SQUIRREL
GOT HIS WINGS<br />
<br />
(Iroquois)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG ago, in the Indian country, Nuk-da-go
was chief of the squirrel tribe. One day
he was passing through the woods to see
how all the little squirrels were faring, and how
they prospered in laying up their store of nuts
for the winter.</p>

<p>Now when Nuk-da-go went about the woods
he often made himself invisible, for by this
means he heard and saw many things which
would not have been said or done if the woods
people had known that he was near.</p>

<p>On this day Nuk-da-go chanced to pass by
the home of a little squirrel, Jo-nis-gy-ont, who
had worked very hard all the autumn laying up
nuts for his winter&rsquo;s food.</p>

<p>Little Jo-nis-gy-ont lived all alone in a hollow
tree close beside a great pine. On one side,
near the edge of a bit of marsh, lived Brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
Frog, and on the other side, under some rocks
near the pine, lived Brother Woodchuck.</p>

<p>Now for some days Jo-nis-gy-ont had been
noticing that his stock of nuts, instead of growing
bigger, was growing smaller, though he
worked hard every day.</p>

<p>The big hickory-nut tree, from which he carried
his stores, was a half-hour&rsquo;s journey away
from the hollow tree. To be sure, there were
acorns and cone seeds much nearer home, but,
as every one knows, the hickory nut is the
sweetest nut of the woods.</p>

<p>But of late, when Jo-nis-gy-ont returned from
one of his long trips with his cheeks bulging
with hickory nuts, he would find <em>fewer</em> nuts
in his storehouse in the hollow tree than he had
left there when he started away. Little Jo-nis-gy-ont
had his own ideas, but he thought it best
to be frank and friendly.</p>

<p>One evening, as he and Brother Frog and
Brother Woodchuck were sitting at the doors
of their houses, little Brother Squirrel said,
&ldquo;Neighbors, I have found that there is a thief
about. My store of nuts is being robbed.&rdquo;
Then he looked hard at Brother Frog and
Brother Woodchuck&mdash;for in those days, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
must know, the frog tribe and the woodchuck
tribe were also eaters of nuts.</p>

<img src="images/plate14.png" width="674" height="435"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;LITTLE JO-NIS-GY-ONT HAD HIS OWN IDEAS&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Brother Frog tried to look very much surprised
as he said, &ldquo;Who would be so mean as
to steal from little Jo-nis-gy-ont&rsquo;s store of hickory
nuts? Such a thing would be a shame!&rdquo;
Then he managed to squeeze two big tears from
his eyes and let them roll slowly down his fat
cheeks.</p>

<p>And Brother Woodchuck said, &ldquo;Surely no one
in the forest would steal from you, little Brother
Squirrel! There must be some mistake. Should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
I see any robber taking your store of nuts, it
would go hard with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But little Jo-nis-gy-ont had his own ideas
still,&mdash;and so did Nuk-da-go, chief of the squirrel
tribe, who was listening, unseen.</p>

<p>That night Nuk-da-go came back to the forest
to look into the matter. He found little
Jo-nis-gy-ont fast asleep; and down beside the
rocks, where Brother Woodchuck had his home,
he could see the dirt flying fast. Brother
Woodchuck was digging for dear life. Nuk-da-go
watched, and as soon as the hole was big
enough, Brother Woodchuck began filling it
with hickory nuts. Then he ran to the hollow
tree, and in a few minutes was back with more
nuts, which he dropped into the hole and covered
carefully from sight.</p>

<p>Then Nuk-da-go went over to the edge of the
marsh, where there was a stirring in the thick
moss. Nuk-da-go watched. Soon he saw Brother
Frog carefully lifting the moss, while he pushed
under it a quantity of hickory nuts. Then
Brother Frog hopped away in the direction of
the hollow tree, and soon he was back, with his
cheeks bulging. Then he dropped more hickory
nuts, which he pushed carefully under the moss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>&ldquo;The hickory-nut tree is a half-hour&rsquo;s journey
away,&rdquo; said the wise Nuk-da-go. &ldquo;I will
look into this matter further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Nuk-da-go went about among
all the forest people and told them that little
Jo-nis-gy-ont&rsquo;s store of nuts was being robbed.
&ldquo;Shall we call a council?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Shall
we bring all the forest people together to find
out who is the robber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the forest people said, &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night the council was held, and all the
forest people came except Brother Frog and
Brother Woodchuck, who begged to be excused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one can be excused from the council,&rdquo;
declared Nuk-da-go, who had been appointed
Chief. &ldquo;Jo-nis-gy-ont, as you are their nearest
neighbor, I appoint you to go and bring them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jo-nis-gy-ont hastened back, but when he told
his errand, Brother Frog jumped far out into
the marsh and pretended not to hear, and
Brother Woodchuck slipped into his home under
the rocks, out of sight.</p>

<p>But Nuk-da-go would be obeyed, so he went
after them himself, and, being Chief of the
Council and Chief of the tribe, Brother Frog
and Brother Woodchuck had to come out when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
he called them, and they followed him along to
the council, looking very meek and very mean
indeed.</p>

<p>Then Nuk-da-go stood up before all the woods
people and told them why he had called them
together, and what he had seen. And when he
had finished telling them about little Jo-nis-gy-ont&rsquo;s
store of nuts, and about the nuts that were
under the rocks, and under the moss, the woods
people looked at Brother Frog and Brother
Woodchuck and they said, &ldquo;We will go and look
into this, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So all the company of woods people went to
the hollow tree near the pine and looked at Jo-nis-gy-ont&rsquo;s
poor little pile of nuts. Then they
went and uncovered the nuts by the rock, and
the nuts that were tucked beneath the moss.
Then they looked at Brother Woodchuck and
Brother Frog, and asked, &ldquo;What have you to
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Brother Woodchuck and Brother Frog
hadn&rsquo;t a word to say! They just looked mean,
and ashamed.</p>

<p>Then the woods people decided that Nuk-da-go
should be the judge. So he told Brother
Frog to sit before him, and he said, &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
pronounce you guilty of stealing your neighbor&rsquo;s
nuts, and you must be punished. You are fat
and lazy. Your food flies past your door, and
you have only to put out your tongue and catch
it. Your little neighbor has to travel far for his
food. You sleep all winter and have no need to
store supplies. Jo-nis-gy-ont stays awake, and
must eat. So your crime is doubly bad, and
this shall be your punishment: Hereafter you
shall not be able to eat nuts, for you shall lose
all your teeth. Go to your home now, and steal
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Frog hopped away, very sad and
very much ashamed, and with the first hop
every one of his teeth dropped out,&mdash;and the
frog tribe have had no teeth from that day to
this.</p>

<p>Then Nuk-da-go turned to Brother Woodchuck,
and said, &ldquo;You, too, are found guilty of
stealing your neighbor&rsquo;s nuts, and you shall
be punished. Like Brother Frog, you are fat
and lazy. You sleep through the winter and
need no food, while Jo-nis-gy-ont must work
hard for his. Go home. You shall not lose your
teeth&mdash;for Brother Woodchuck was holding his
paws tightly over his mouth and quaking with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
fear&mdash;but from this day on you and your tribe
shall live upon leaves and grain and the growing
things of the fields and forests, but no more
shall you enjoy the taste of flesh, or the sweet
meat of nuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sad and ashamed, Brother Woodchuck turned
away when Nuk-da-go finished speaking, for this
was a hard punishment indeed.</p>

<p>Then Nuk-da-go turned to little Brother Squirrel
and said, &ldquo;Jo-nis-gy-ont, you should have
been more watchful of your store of nuts, and
not have slept so soundly when robbers were
about. But the woods people are sorry for
you, and so I shall give you something that
will help you to go quickly from tree to tree,
and to hasten home in time of danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Nuk-da-go spread a web of skin from
the fore legs to the back legs of Jo-nis-gy-ont,
to form wings when he leaped, so that he could
jump swiftly and far.</p>

<p>From that day to this the tribe of Jo-nis-gy-ont
has had wings, and this is the Indians&rsquo;
account of the first flying squirrel.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>WHY BROTHER BEAR WEARS
A STUMPY TAIL<br />
<br />
(Ojibwa)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N times long past Brother Bear was a
famous fisherman. He had a large stock of
patience, and great good nature. He was never
in a hurry.</p>

<p>But Brother Bear was honest as he was slow,
and always ready to believe what others told
him, and so he was often imposed upon by the
slyer animals&mdash;Brother Fox, for instance.</p>

<p>One day as Brother Fox was walking beside a
stream, he saw a group of plump little animals
slip into the water and disappear from sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young otters, I do believe!&rdquo; cried Brother
Fox, smacking his lips. &ldquo;What a meal they
would make!&rdquo; Then he sat down beside the
stream and began to think. He did want those
otters so badly! He could not think of anything
else that would taste half so good. But
how to get them! That was the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>Presently, while he was thinking, along came
Brother Bear shuffling down the path with a
load of nuts and honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Brother Bear,&rdquo; said Brother
Fox. &ldquo;I see you have a load of excellent food&mdash;excellent
for you, I mean. My tribe never
eats nuts or honey. But perhaps you would
not mind adding a bit of tender meat to your
load.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meat? No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Brother Bear.
&ldquo;But where am I to find it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Brother Fox with his craftiest
smile, &ldquo;there are some young otters in this
stream. I just saw them slip into the water.
It seems to me that they would make very good
eating for you and your family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Bear smacked his lips. &ldquo;But how
am I to get them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no fisherman, as you well know,&rdquo; said
Brother Fox, &ldquo;but you are a famous fisherman.
Why can you not fish for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Bear thought for a moment. &ldquo;But
I have no bait,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied Brother Fox, &ldquo;but I
will tell you what to do. Just go out upon that
log that lies near the shore and drop your fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
long tail into the water. I feel sure the otters
will think your tail good bait, and when one
comes to nibble it, you can jerk up your tail
and just whip the otter over to the shore. I
will guard your game for you until you finish
fishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; agreed Brother Bear, &ldquo;I will
try that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Brother Bear laid down his load of nuts
and honey, made his way to the log, and climbed
upon it. Then he let his fine long tail drop down
into the water&mdash;for this was in times long past,
you must remember, when the tails of the bears
were long&mdash;and then he closed his eyes and sat
very still.</p>

<p>Presently he felt a nibble at his tail, and he
whipped it up, as Brother Fox had told him.
Sure enough, a fine young otter went flying
across to the bank where Brother Fox lay waiting
behind a bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was pretty well done!&rdquo; thought Brother
Bear, as he dropped his tail into the water again
and waited. Presently he felt another nibble,
and another otter went flying across to the bank.
And soon it was followed by a fish, and then
by another fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>&ldquo;What a fine dinner I shall take home to my
family,&rdquo; thought Brother Bear to himself, as
he began trying to count the number of times
his tail had been nibbled, and he had sent something
flying across for Brother Fox to guard.</p>

<p>While he was trying to count, North Wind
came along and saw him sitting there with his
eyes closed, and his tail hanging down in the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to play a trick on Brother Bear,
I do believe!&rdquo; chuckled North Wind to himself,
and he sent a cold breath over the water,
so that it became quite still. Then he sent
another breath, and a cold, shining crust formed
all across its top. After that he sent another
breath, and another, and the cold, shining crust
grew thicker and thicker.</p>

<p>Presently Brother Bear stopped trying to
count and opened his eyes. &ldquo;Brother Fox,&rdquo; he
called, &ldquo;there seems to be no more game in the
river. I have not felt a nibble for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Brother Fox was just finishing a nice
bone, and he called back earnestly, &ldquo;Oh, be
patient, Brother Bear! I am sure you will catch
more game if you wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;NORTH WIND SAW HIM SITTING THERE WITH HIS EYES
CLOSED AND HIS TAIL HANGING DOWN IN THE WATER&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So Brother Bear closed his eyes again and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
sat still for several minutes. Then he called,
&ldquo;Brother Fox, I am sure there is no more game
in the river. I am coming ashore now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer from Brother Fox, so
Brother Bear moved a little on the log, but it
was a very little, for his tail felt heavy as lead.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I must have an enormous
fish now, my tail is so heavy!&rdquo; And with
that he gave a great jump, intending to carry
the game with him to shore, when, snap! his
tail broke right off short, for it was frozen
fast in the ice. And that was the trick that
North Wind had played.</p>

<p>Brother Bear felt terribly at losing his tail,
it had been such a beautiful, long one! But
at last he comforted himself by thinking, &ldquo;Well,
at any rate, I have a wonderful feast to carry
home to the family: nuts, and honey, and fish,
and game.&rdquo; So he licked his lips, in spite of
the loss of his tail.</p>

<p>But when Brother Bear reached the shore,
he could not find Brother Fox anywhere! And
neither could he find the fish, nor the tender
young otters. Instead, he found a heap of
fresh bones back of the bush where Brother
Fox had been lying. And then he knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
Brother Fox had played a bad trick upon him,
too.</p>

<p>He gathered up his load of nuts and honey
and went sadly home. And from that day to
this Brother Bear has refused to do any more
fishing, and has worn a stumpy tail.</p>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>THE THUNDER PEOPLE<br />
<br />
(Passamaquoddy)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time a young Indian warrior
was hunting with his bow and arrows. He
followed far after a fleet deer, until he found
himself standing upon a great rock, high above
the plains.</p>

<p>The clouds were gathering thickly. The sky
was black with clouds. The Indian youth was
far away from his lodge.</p>

<p>Again he saw the deer, and he drew his bow.
But as he did so the deer was changed into
the form of a maiden, standing against the rock.</p>

<p>The youth dropped his bow in wonder. He
looked at the maiden. In the distance he heard
the voice of the thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked in amazement.</p>

<p>And the maiden answered, &ldquo;I am the sister
of the Thunder Men. Will you come with me
and visit our home?&rdquo; The youth consented,
and the maiden struck the great rock against
which she had stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>There was a flash, like a flash of lightning,
and the rock opened and made a passage for
them.</p>

<p>The maiden led the way, and the youth followed;
and when they had passed through the
rock, they came into a strange country&mdash;to the
home of the Thunder Maiden. The floors and
walls were of clouds, and the clouds were of
every shade, from silver gray to the deepest
purple black. They were soft to walk upon,
and smooth as the smoothest velvet. And their
changing shades were more wonderful than any
artist could paint.</p>

<p>The maiden&rsquo;s robes were of trailing silver, and
her hair was black as midnight.</p>

<p>She led the youth to her father, who sat upon
a throne formed from the deepest purple clouds.
His hair and beard were white like the mists
that float across the sky. But his robe was
black, with here and there a dash of brilliant
gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, my son,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Have
you come to dwell among us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth looked at the beautiful maiden,
and he answered, &ldquo;Yes, my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he became one of the Thunder People.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>After a time the brothers of the maiden
returned home. And when they saw the youth
and knew that he had come to dwell among
them, they proposed a game of ball.</p>

<p>Now their balls were big and black, and very
heavy; and they did not throw them, but rolled
them back and forth across the clouds. And
the noise was very great.</p>

<p>When the father of the Thunder Men saw
that the youth was strong, and could roll the
ball well, he said, &ldquo;You shall go with my sons
to-morrow. You shall see greater sport than
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning, when the Thunder Men put
on their great purple wings, the maiden brought
forth another pair and fastened them upon the
shoulders of the youth. Then they all flew
away to the south. They carried bows, and
their arrows were of gold.</p>

<p>Their wings made a mighty roaring and
crashing as they flew, and the people on the
earth said, &ldquo;Listen, how the thunder roars and
crashes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they shot their golden arrows from
their bows, and the earth people cried, &ldquo;See,
how the lightning flashes across the sky!&rdquo; And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
some of the earth people ran and hid, for they
were afraid.</p>

<p>But the old man of the Thunder World had
said to his sons: &ldquo;Shoot your arrows only at
the great bird of the south, which is our enemy.
Destroy not the people of the earth. And fly
not too low. Touch not the trees, for they are
our friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they flew about for a time, taking care
where they sent their arrows. And when they
had grown tired of their sport, they flew back
to their home in the clouds and took off their
great purple wings.</p>

<p>For many moons the youth enjoyed the company
of the Thunder Maiden, and took part
in the sports of her brothers. But at last there
took possession of him a great longing to visit
again his brothers and sisters of the earth.
He longed to chase the deer in the forest, to
follow his chief in battle, to smell the fire of
his lodge.</p>

<p>He told his longing to the old man of the
Thunder World, and the old man said he should
have his way. So for the last time the Thunder
Maiden fastened his purple wings to his shoulders,
handed him the golden arrows, and bade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
him good-bye. Then away he flew with the
Thunder Men.</p>

<p>Closer and closer to the earth they went,
and the people covered their ears to keep out
the crash and roar of the thunder; and they
covered their eyes to keep out the sight of the
dazzling, flashing lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a storm!&rdquo; cried the earth people,
as they looked toward a hill outside their village
where the noise seemed most deafening,
and the glare seemed most blinding.</p>

<p>And there, on the hill, the Thunder Men left
their Indian brother; then, with many a rumble
and flash, they flew away back to their home
in the clouds.</p>

<p>When the people looked again, the storm had
lifted, and a warrior was seen descending from
the hill to the village. They recognized him
as the youth who had been lost for many, many
moons.</p>

<p>As they sat together around the fire of the
lodge, the youth told them the tale that I
have told you, of the Thunder People who dwell
in the purple clouds.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>KEEPER OF THE WINDS<br />
<br />
(Algonquin)</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>UDJEKEEWIS, father of the four winds
of heaven, had three sons. Their names
were Wabun, Kabibonokka, and Shawondasee.
Mudjekeewis said to the chiefs of his people,
&ldquo;You have named me Kabeyun, the West Wind,
and have given to me all the four winds of the
heavens. I will appoint my three sons to be
keepers of the north wind, the east wind, and
the south wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So to Kabibonokka he gave the north wind,
to Wabun he gave the east wind, and to Shawondasee
he gave the south wind.</p>

<p>Wabun was a hunter. He liked to rise early
and to leap upon the mountains in pursuit of
the wild deer. He liked to shoot with his
bow and arrows. He was glad that the east
wind had been given to him, for he loved to
watch the heavens in the early morning when
the sun shot its first rays across the mountain
tops where he hunted. He said to Mudjekeewis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am most grateful, my father, that the east
wind has been given into my keeping. When
I hunt in the early morning I will shoot away
the clouds of darkness with my silver arrows;
I will chase away the shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Wabun cared for the east wind, and each
morning he painted the sky with wonderful
colors. He sent his silver arrows down to the
earth to waken the people, and to light up the
lakes and meadows.</p>

<p>At last Wabun grew lonely in his home in
the eastern sky, and he began to watch day
by day for a beautiful maiden who walked upon
the prairie gathering grasses for her baskets.
And Wabun wooed her with his soft breezes,
and with sweet flowers, and with the songs of
birds. And when he had won her heart he
changed her into a beautiful star, which he
set in his home in the heavens.</p>

<p>Kabibonokka, the second son, was very different
from Wabun. He was cold and cruel,
and he was glad that the north wind had been
given to him. When he sent his winds across
the earth the leaves upon the trees turned to
crimson and gold, and were very lovely, but
they whirled and twisted in the wind and said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
to each other, &ldquo;Our days will soon be at an
end. We shall soon turn dry and brown and
fall to the earth. Kabibonokka laughs when
we put on our beautiful colors.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35.062em;">
<a name="plate16" id="plate16"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/plate16.png" width="561" height="800"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;WABUN WOOED HER WITH HIS SOFT BREEZES ...
AND THE SONGS OF BIRDS&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then Kabibonokka sent icy blasts, and the
waters of the lakes froze, and the snows fell,
and the winds came through the door of the
tepee, and life became hard for the people.
And Kabibonokka laughed, and his laugh was
like the whistling of the wind through the bare
tree tops. The fish were deep beneath the
frozen waters; the snow covered the tracks of
the animals of the forest. Food was scarce, and
hard to obtain.</p>

<p>Only the bravest of the Indians could fish
and hunt when the north wind blew its coldest.
Shingebis was one of these, and he never lacked
for fish or fuel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get the best of Shingebis,&rdquo; said Kabibonokka,
and so one morning he went to Shingebis&rsquo;
tepee. And Shingebis asked him to eat
with him, and he gave him a meal of fish. And
Kabibonokka ate greedily. But the warmth of
Shingebis&rsquo; tepee was too great for him, and
he had to go away. As he left he tried to put
out the tepee fire, but Shingebis blew upon it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
and it burned more brightly, so that Kabibonokka
had to hasten. In revenge he froze the
waters more deeply, but Shingebis only laughed,
for no weather was too cold for him to find
fish for his dinner.</p>

<p>But the Indians did not love Kabibonokka,
for he was cold and cruel.</p>

<p>Shawondasee was not like either of his brothers.
He was fat and lazy. He loved to lie
upon green banks under shady trees. He loved
the sweet flowers, and the warmth of the South
Land. He was far too lazy to send strong
winds such as came from the North Land. His
breezes were soft and traveled slowly, and they
were sweet with the perfume of southern groves
and meadows.</p>

<p>Shawondasee, like his brother Wabun, saw a
beautiful maiden that he loved. Do you remember
the story? Her hair was of golden yellow,
and she nodded and swayed in the breeze. Her
home was in the meadows, and Shawondasee
looked for her day by day, and wafted sweet
odors and fair flowers to her, and he won her
love, even as Wabun won the love of the prairie
maiden. But he was too sluggish to go himself
to win her, and to bring her to his home in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
South Land. Instead he said to himself each
morning, &ldquo;To-day I will go and seek the golden-haired
maiden, and bring her to my home,&rdquo; but
each day he was too indolent.</p>

<p>The days went by, and at last the golden hair
of the maiden turned silvery white, and when
Shawondasee saw this he heaved a great sigh,
so great a sigh that it reached even to the
maiden, and lo, all the silver white of her hair
was scattered over the meadow!</p>

<p>So Shawondasee still lives alone in the South
Land, and sends gentle sighing breezes to the
meadows of the North.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
